## Comparison

To understand the effect of larger training data, we compare the previous tables by substracting the scores from Experiment 2 and Experiment 1. In this way, it is possible to visualize the effect of larger pretraining data - particularly in the Feat. Ext. configuration. As mentioned in the paper, CPC allows for improvement when pretraining on a mixture of languages.
